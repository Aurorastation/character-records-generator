# Aurora Record Generator, 2464 edition

An updated fork of the AuroraRecordGenerator created originally by Lohikar to make setting up employment, medical, and security records a little easier on Aurora.

This version of the record generator has been made up to date with all of the latest changes to the server, and to better match the example records present on [Aurora's Guide to Character Records](https://wiki.aurorastation.org/index.php?title=Guide_to_Character_Records). Some redundant fields have been removed, and nearly all of the fields are now optional rather than being listed as 'not specified', hopefully to make filling out the records less of a chore if you want to do it piece by piece as you play.
